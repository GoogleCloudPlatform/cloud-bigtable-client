bigtable-client-core is in the process of being removed. java-bigtable-hbase
is being migrated to use [java-bigtable](https://github.com/googleapis/java-bigtable). If
you were using bigtable-client-core directly, you can find it's source in the bigtable-1.x
branch: https://github.com/googleapis/java-bigtable-hbase/tree/master/bigtable-client-core-parent/bigtable-client-core/

However, customers encouraged to migrate to [java-bigtable](https://github.com/googleapis/java-bigtable).
